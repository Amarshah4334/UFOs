# The Truth is Out There
# UFOs
Build a dynamic table, react to user input using JavaScript and incorporate it into a web site using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.



Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

1. ***Deliverable 1***: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
2. ***Deliverable 2***: A written report on the UFO analysis

## Resources 

* Data Source: `ufo_starterCode.js` and `index.html`
* Data Tools: Visual Studio Code, JavaScript, Python and MongoDB
* Software: JavaScript, MongoDB, Python, Visual Studio Code

# Deliverable 1:  
## Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
### Deliverable Requirements:

1. The list element that creates the button is removed, and there are five list elements for filtering in the `index.html` file. 
2. The event listener is modified to detect changes to each filter in the `app.js` file.
3. ​The `updateFilters()` function saves the element, value, and the id of the filter that was changed.
4. The filterTable() function loops through all of the filters and keeps any data that matches the filter values.
5. The webpage filters the table correctly based on user input.

 
### Results with detail analysis:
Using JavaScript and HTML, i have  modified the code in index.html file to create more table filters. In addition to the date filter i created in this module, i have added filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
Using JavaScript, i have replaced the handleClick() function in my app.js file with a new function that saves the element, value, and id of the filter that was changed. Then, i created a new function to loop through the dataset and keep only the results that match the search criteria. The webpage will be updated with the search criteria after pressing "Enter".


# Deliverable 2: 
## A written report on the UFO analysis
### Deliverable Requirements:

1. **Overview of Project:** Explain the purpose of this analysis. 
2. **Results:** Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
3. **​Summary:** In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.


 
### Results with detail analysis:


1. **Overview of Project:** 
Create a dynamic and interactive webpage to filter UFO sightings data in different places.

2. **Results:** 
The webpage is an interactive an fun to work with format. The table of data that is included is extensive, however when the filter is applied the results that are shown is narrowed based on the users search criteria.
You can search based on all listed parameters {created in deliverable 1} on the left and once you press enter the webpage will refresh and new data will be based on user input.
the end results based on the data are incredible but the question persists UFO: Myth or Fact? 

3. ​**​Summary:**
> Drawbacks:

A. Data is collected from various sources and their credibility was never established.


B. Documentation of said events is necessary to populate in data and publish to general public without creation of panic 


C. Data presented is restricted to places in {USA} one country and more data can be found worldwide that was excluded.


> Recommendations:


1. **Data validation and verified documentation**
When source is cited the credibility must be determined on the basis of minimum 3 sources who are unrelated to each other in seperate places verifying the data 

2. **Broader search radius**
Getting worldwide sightings data will be helpful in understanding demographics and peoples thoughtprocesses . Also helps understand the mindset of people presenting, credibility and variations. forexample someone saw a flying Saucer aat one time vs another person saw a fighter jet have varied inputs and places data in jeopardy Vs. another set of unrelated individuals seeing same exact object of sahpe and size from different angles provides concrete credibility to information derived. 

3. **Time spent between said event and testimony collection**
Time is a crucial factor in collection of data/testimonials so it may not be changed/altered or edited. the fastest data collection has lesser chance of "adding stock to a fairy tale". more the story is said more is the chance of getting it "juiced" or "spiced_up".
